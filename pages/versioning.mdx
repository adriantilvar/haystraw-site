# Versioning

The latest version of the API is Version 1. All requests not specifying a version will receive the latest version of the API. You can specify the version through a media type parameter in the Accept header to avoid breaking changes when a new major version is released. An example of this is shown below in the subsection 'Request Accept header'.
