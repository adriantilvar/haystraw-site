# Getting started

### Base URL

The base URL is **_api.haystraw.io_** and functions as the entry point of the API. Send a GET request to the base URL to explore the resources of the API.

### Authentication

Calling any endpoint (except for the base URL) will require an API key specified in the X-API-Key header. To get started, sign up for one of our API access subscription plans. Once registered, you'll receive an API key, which you'll use for authentication.
(need to add hyperlinks)

Your API key is linked to your account, so it's important that you store it in a secure way. Ensure it is not shown as clear text anywhere (e.g. in your code, in the terminal, etc.). If you suspect somebody knows your API key please reach out to us immediately at hello@heystraw.io, so we can disable it and issue a new one.

### Versioning

The latest version of the API is `Version 1`. All requests not specifying a version will receive the latest version of the API. You can specify the version through a media type parameter in the Accept header to avoid breaking changes when a new major version is released. An example of this is shown below in the subsection 'Request Accept header'.

### Media types and content negotiation

The following media type and media type parameters are supported:

`application/json; charset=utf-8; version=1`

**Request Accept header**

To accommodate future media types and avoid potential breaking changes caused by default responses, we recommend specifying your preferences in the Accept header when making a request. For example:

`Accept: application/json; charset=utf-8; version=1`

**Response Content-Type header**

By default, all returned responses have the following Content-Type header:

`Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8; version=1`

In most of the examples in the documentation weâ€™ve left out the Accept header for simplicity. However, as stated before, we highly recommend it being specified by the client.
