# Authentication

Calling any endpoint (except for the base URL) will require an API key specified in the X-API-Key header. To get started, sign up for one of our API access subscription plans. Once registered, you'll receive an API key, which you'll use for authentication. (need to add hyperlinks)

Your API key is linked to your account, so it's important that you store it in a secure way. Ensure it is not shown as clear text anywhere (e.g. in your code, in the terminal, etc.). If you suspect somebody knows your API key please reach out to us immediately at hello@heystraw.io, so we can disable it and issue a new one.
